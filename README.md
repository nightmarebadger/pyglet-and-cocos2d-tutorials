# The source

You can find the source for the tutorials here, while the tutorials themselves
are located at [my blog](http://www.natan.termitnjak.net/tutorials/).

# The tutorials

The tutorials are made by me and as such, it is possible that they could teach
you non-optimal or even wrong ways to do things, or something might simply not
work.

If you do find anything wrong with them, or know of a better way to do
things, feel free to message me here or leave a comment on the blog.
